              <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
              <p class="text-right">
                I am a fourth-year student at Portland State University studying
                computer science. In my first year at PSU, I worked as a lab
                attendant for OIT. My main job was to assist users with
                technical difficulties and maintain a clean and proper lab. The
                skills I developed and improved while working as a member of OIT
                are communication skills, people skills, critical thinking, and
                problem-solving. I worked with OIT till my third year at PSU,
                where I got accepted into MECOP and got my first spring-summer
                internship at Cognex. At Cognex, I worked as a Software Engineer
                Intern for their application software team. During my
                internship, I worked on a couple of projects. The first project
                I worked on was building an image filter for their cameras, and
                the main project I worked on was automating firmware loading for
                their newest cameras. Lastly, I worked on minor bugs. Because
                Mecop offers two six-month internships, I will be interning at
                Thermo Fisher Scientific in Eugene Oregon spring-summer of 2023.

                <h2>First Mecop Internship</h2>
                <p class="text-right">
                  For my first internship with Mecop, I interned at Cognex. At
                  Cognex, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern for the
                  software applications team called team Ocelot. There were a
                  handful of people on this team, including me, two other
                  interns and three mentors, and a couple of others. The main
                  project the other interns and I worked on was automating
                  device reconfiguration. As part of this project, I was tasked
                  with automating firmware loading/updating for their newest
                  vision systems. During my internship, I learned many new
                  things about C#, web APIs, and automation.

                <h2>PSU OIT</h2>
                <p class="text-right">
                  During my first and second years at PSU, I worked as an OIT
                  lab attendant and a remote class support line. While working
                  as an OIT lab attendant before Covid, I would help students
                  with technical problems like issues with PSU computers,
                  internet/wifi, loading software for users, and many others. I
                  enjoyed working there very much. My coworkers and managers are
                  very understanding because they are students as well. I found
                  pleasure in helpings others and seeing the relief that they
                  get after their issue has been solved. During Covid, I worked
                  a remote class support line where I did very similar tasks as
                  a lab attendent, but instead of face-to-face interaction it
                  was through phone calls.

                  For this project, I created an airline application that allows
                  users to store airlines and flights on the web. The airlines
                  and flights are formatted with XML making it easier to read.
                  Through command line arguments the users will be able to add
                  or search for airlines and flights.

                  what I wrote.
